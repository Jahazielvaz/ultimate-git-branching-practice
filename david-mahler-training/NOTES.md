## IMPORTANT COMMANDS/ACTIONS
### NOTE: Whenever quotations are added to these notes like so "", it does not mean string, but rather we're indicating what should be typed in the terminal
- Getting out of the git log scrollable less program:
  * q : This is how you quit the scrollable bash
  * h : Help

- Looking at the master branching graph:
  * git log --all --decorate --online --graph

- Creating an instance of a specific command (With this command you can store a specific command into any word you want. You can then access that command by typing in the word. NOTE: This only works on the directory that you create the original command. Furthermore, it only works for the current session. As soon as you close the terminal it resets):
  * alias dir="mkdir" (If I did this. Instead of having to type mkdir in order to make a directory, I would simply type in dir)
